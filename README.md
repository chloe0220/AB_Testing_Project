# AB_Testing_Project
# A company sells a software for $39. Since revenue has been flat for some time, the VP of Product has decided to run a test increasing the price. She hopes that this would increase revenue. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price ($39), while a random sample of 33% users a higher price ($59).
# They would like to know: should the company sell its software for 39 or 59?
